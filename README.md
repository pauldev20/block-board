## The Problem

Traditional methods of **communication and advertisement** – billboards, newspapers, TV – are limited by geography, high costs, and opacity. For advertisers, it's hard to measure genuine reach. For the public, content is often out of their control. Smaller voices struggle to be heard amidst monopolistic giants.
<br />
<br />

## Our Solution

**BlockBoard** aims to revolutionize communication and advertisement by leveraging Blockchain technology. It offers a decentralized platform where users can **rent physical message boards**. They can **manage the time and location** of their messages by interacting with Smart contracts.
<br />

### Key Features
1. **Decentralized Management**: With BlockBoard, no central entity controls the message boards. Anyone can rent space on a board by engaging with the associated smart contract.
2. **Proof of Display**: Using IoT devices and blockchain, BlockBoard provides verifiable proof that an advertisement or message was displayed on a board for a given duration, helping advertisers measure genuine reach.
3. **Dynamic Pricing**: Pricing is based on demand and location. The transparent pricing mechanism ensures fair pricing for all.
4. **Accessible to All**: Anyone, regardless of their resources, can rent a message board for their personal, commercial, or social messages. 
5. **Environmental Concerns**: BlockBoard promotes the use of electronic message boards, which reduce the need for paper-based advertisement, supporting a more eco-friendly approach.
6. **Secure Payment System**: Payments are made via ETH or any ERC-20 token. Smart contracts handle the funds, releasing them to the board owner only when proof of display is verified.
8. **Scalability**: BlockBoard has the potential to integrate with other blockchain projects, opening doors for collaborations with augmented reality platforms, geolocation-based services, and more.
