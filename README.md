### The Problem:

Traditional methods of communication and advertisement, such as physical bulletin boards, posters, and flyers, are often static, localized, and lack efficient management. These methods can also be wasteful, as they generate paper waste and lack a dynamic, trackable, and secure way of conveying messages to a targeted audience.

### BlockBoard Solution:

BlockBoard aims to revolutionize communication and advertisement by leveraging Blockchain technology. It offers a decentralized platform where users can "rent" virtual message boards that are secured and managed on the blockchain.
